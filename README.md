# LuxemBERT-datasets
LuxemBERT is a BERT-like model trained on Luxembourgish text data.

In addition to the model, we created multiple datasets for evaluation purposes.
These tasks include Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, News Classification, and a Luxembourgish version of the Winograd Natural Language Inference task. (https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html)

We make the WNLI dataset publically available. If you would like to access the POS, NER, or News Classification datasets, please send a request to cedric.lothritz [at] uni.lu
